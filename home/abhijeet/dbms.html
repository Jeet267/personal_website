        A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system designed to manage databases. It provides an interface for users to create, retrieve, update, and manage data in a structured and efficient manner. DBMSs are essential for handling large amounts of data and ensuring data integrity, security, and consistency. They support various data models, such as relational, hierarchical, and network models, allowing for flexible data organization and manipulation. Common examples of DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. These systems are widely used in various applications, from banking and finance to e-commerce and healthcare, to manage and analyze data effectively.

    <p>Normalization in Database Management Systems (DBMS) is a technique used to organize data in a relational database. It involves structuring the database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. The process typically follows these steps:<br>

        1. First Normal Form (1NF): Eliminate repeating groups and ensure atomic values
        2. Second Normal Form (2NF): Remove partial dependencies
        3. Third Normal Form (3NF): Eliminate transitive dependencies
        
        Higher normal forms like Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) and Fourth Normal Form (4NF) also exist for more complex scenarios. Normalization helps prevent update anomalies, reduces data duplication, and makes the database more efficient and easier to maintain.
        
        First Normal Form (1NF) is the initial step in the normalization process. It involves:
        
        - Eliminating repeating groups: Each column should contain atomic (indivisible) values
        - Identifying the primary key: Ensure each row is uniquely identifiable
        - Removing duplicate columns from the same table
        
        1NF helps to simplify the database structure and lays the foundation for further normalization steps.</p>
